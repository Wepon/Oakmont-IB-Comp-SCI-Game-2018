# Art Folder:space_invader:

For the art created, please place the images within this folder.
For the Art:
* Make sure all files are in the same format (.png, .jpg, .3d, etc.)
* 2D Models
  * Be careful about size of files
    * The Size matters heavily - 256x256 is DIFFERENT from 1920x1080 pixels
  * The art style needs to be heavily similar - use the same tools so the art cant be distunguished who drew it
* 3D Models
  * All is same format and compatible with the game engine
  * make sure they are rendered in a size comparable to the other models - some modeling programs have built in scaling features to fix this
